This web app is designed for users to to play "Pick'em" Fantasy Football.

## Whats Pick'em Fantasy Football???
 The object is for the user to predict the winner of each and every NFL game, on a weekly basis. Each user assigns a point value for each game based on their certainty of the game outcome (ie 13 points if the pick will DEFINITELY be right and 1 point if it's a rough guess). Each correct prediction yeilds the user the assigned point value.  Score is totaled for all picks for the week, and a running total is compiled for the season.
